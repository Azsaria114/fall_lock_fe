FallLock System is a government-approved initiative that provides a temporary Borewell Safety Kit to secure open borewells, preventing tragic incidents.With our easy registration and request system, users can apply for a Borewell Safety Kit and contribute to making their surroundings safer. Once the borewell is permanently sealed, the kit must be returned to ensure its availability for others in need.</p>
